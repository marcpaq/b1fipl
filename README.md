# A Bestiary of Single-File Implementations of Programming Languages

## Introduction

Programming languages are amazing pieces of work. They turn our words, numbers, and symbols into the bits that make a machine do things.

It's easy to get overwhelmed when implementing a programming language. The GNU Compiler Collection is [millions of lines long](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE1OTg).

That's too complicated to learn how to implement a programming language. Luckily, some smart people have distilled the most interesting parts of programming languages into an approachable essence. I'm referring to implementations of programming languages that fit in a single source code file.

These single-file implementations are rarely complete, hardly sophisticated or efficient. But they are self-contained, concise, and clear. They make it fun to discover why programming languages are amazing.

## Logical

[microKanren](https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren-DLS-16/blob/master/mk.rkt) is a Kanren interpreter, implemented by Jason Hemann.

[prolog.c](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/research/funnel/prolog.c) is a simple Prolog interpreter written in C++, implemented by Alan Mycroft.

## Honourable Mentions

[256LOL](http://blog.jeff.over.bz/assembly/compilers/jit/2017/01/15/x86-assembler.html) implemented by Jeff Overbey. An x86 assembler in 256 lines or less. Technically not a single file but Jeff gives good descriptions of the problems with elegant, simple solutions.

[An Implementation of J](http://www.jsoftware.com/books/pdf/aioj.pdf) implemented by Arthur Whitney. See the appendix "Incunabulum". It's only a fragment of the J interpreter, but its conciseness is impressive.

[Microlisp](https://github.com/lazear/microlisp), a Scheme-like lisp in less than 1000 loc of C, implemented by Michael Lazear. A single-implementation with extra files for examples and building.

[Tiny Compiler](http://blog.mgechev.com/2017/09/16/developing-simple-interpreter-transpiler-compiler-tutorial/) implemented by Minko Gechev. It translates only arithmetic expressions, but it's well written.
